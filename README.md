# Digital-Logic-Circuit-Simplification
# Circuit Equivalence and satisfiability Checker

This program evaluates two Boolean circuit expressions (an **original** and a **simplified** version), generates their truth tables, verifies if the outputs of both expressions are equivalent, and determines the satisfiable inputs under certain conditions. If both expressions are not satisfiable, the simplified expression is modified iteratively to find a satisfiable configuration.

## Features

1. **Generate Truth Tables**:
   - Computes the truth table for the original Boolean expression.
   - Computes the truth table for the simplified Boolean expression.

2. **Expression Equivalence Check**:
   - Compares the outputs of the original and simplified expressions for all possible inputs to determine if they are equivalent.

3. **Satisfiability Check**:
   - Finds input combinations that satisfy both the original and simplified expressions.
   - If both expression is not satisfiable, the program modifies the simplified expression iteratively to find the one achive satisfiability.

4. **Input Modifications**:
   - Supports multiple modifications of the simplified expression to explore satisfiability only when both the original and simplified expressions are unsatisfiable.

## How It Works

### Boolean Expressions
The following expressions are evaluated:
- **Original Expression**:  
  `((A && B) || ((B || C) && (B && C)) || ((B && C) && (!(B && C))))`
  
- **Simplified Expression**:  
  `(A && B) || (B && C)`

Additionally, alternative simplified expressions are tested only if both the original and simplified expressions are unsatisfiable.

### Truth Table
The program iterates through all possible combinations of inputs (`A`, `B`, `C`) and evaluates the outputs for each expression.

### Satisfiability Check
The program determines the combinations of inputs where:
1. The original expression evaluates to `true`.
2. The simplified expression evaluates to `true`.

If neither expression is satisfiable, the program modifies the simplified expression and reevaluates it with the original expression until a satisfiable configuration is found or all modifications are exhausted.

### Output
1. Truth tables for both original and simplified expressions.
2. Whether the original and simplified expressions are equivalent.
3. Satisfiable input combinations for the selected modification of the simplified expression.
